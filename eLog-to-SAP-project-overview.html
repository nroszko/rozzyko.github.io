        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Automatic Categorization:</strong> Automatically tags eLog entries based on content, saving time and ensuring consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Mapping:</strong> Bridges the gap between eLog and SAP by using an external table to match eLog locations with SAP functional locations (FL).</li>
            <li><strong>Failure Reports and Call-Outs:</strong> Provides tailored forms for different scenarios, ensuring accurate and efficient reporting in SAP.</li>
            <li><strong>Notification Search:</strong> Quickly locates previous notifications related to a specific eLog location by integrating with SAP's search interface.</li>
            <li><strong>SMART Integration:</strong> Enables direct creation of Hazard ID and Near Miss forms in SMART, pre-filled with relevant details from eLog entries.</li>
            <li><strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> Fetches and caches location data to ensure the latest information is always available.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How It Works</h3>
        <p>The extension integrates with eLog, SMART, and SAP to automate key processes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Mapping:</strong> Matches eLog entries with SAP FLs using a preloaded location table, allowing for seamless transition between systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Form Pre-Fill:</strong> Populates SAP failure reports, call-out notifications, and SMART safety forms using eLog data.</li>
            <li><strong>Crowdsourced Updates:</strong> Operators can add missing SAP FLs directly, updating the location table for all users.</li>
        </ul>
